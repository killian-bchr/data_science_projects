Music recommendation system

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a music recommendation system based on a user's listening history. The goal is to analyze musical features and listening patterns to provide personalized recommendations.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Spotify API – To retrieve track details and user listening history.
LastFM API – To gather additional metadata on tracks and artists.
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.) – For data processing and machine learning.
🚀 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection
Retrieve all tracks and their features from the Spotify API and LastFM API.
Store the collected data in a structured format for further analysis.
2️⃣ Data Processing & Feature Engineering
Vectorization & Scaling: Convert music features into a machine-learning-friendly format.
Dimensionality Reduction: Optimize feature representation for efficient processing.
3️⃣ Clustering & Categorization
Apply clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.) to group tracks based on their characteristics.
Categorize tracks into meaningful clusters for sharper recommendations.
4️⃣ Similarity Analysis
Build a similarity matrix to identify tracks with similar audio features.
Use distance metrics to find the closest matches for recommendation.
5️⃣ Listening Pattern Analysis
Identify user-specific listening patterns to refine recommendations.
Integrate listening frequency, genre preferences, and time-based trends.
📌 Future Improvements
Implement collaborative filtering to incorporate user preferences.
Train a classification model (SVM, Random Forest, etc.) to predict song preferences.
Improve clustering efficiency with advanced unsupervised learning techniques.
