# Music Recommendation System

# ==============================
# Project Overview
# ==============================
# This project aims to build a music recommendation system based on the user's listening history.
# The system analyzes track features and listening patterns to provide personalized recommendations.

# ==============================
# Tools Used
# ==============================
# - Spotify API: To retrieve track details and user listening history.
# - LastFM API: To gather additional metadata on tracks and artists.
# - Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc., for data processing and machine learning.

# ==============================
# Project Steps
# ==============================

# 1. Data Collection
# ------------------
# - Retrieve tracks and their features from the Spotify API and LastFM API.
# - Store the data in a structured format for further processing.

# 2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
# --------------------------------------
# - Vectorize and scale features for consistency.
# - Normalize and prepare the data for clustering and classification.

# 3. Clustering & Similarity Analysis
# -----------------------------------
# - Apply clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN) to group similar tracks.
# - Build a similarity matrix to identify tracks with close features.

# 4. Listening Pattern Analysis
# -----------------------------
# - Identify patterns in user listening history to improve recommendations.

# ==============================
# Future Improvements
# ==============================
# - Integrate collaborative filtering to enhance personalization.
# - Train classification models (SVM, Random Forest, etc.) to predict user preferences.
# - Experiment with advanced clustering techniques to improve accuracy.
